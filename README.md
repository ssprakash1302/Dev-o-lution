# EcoCups Insight
## Tech-Driven Visualizations to Tackle the Environmental Impact of Paper Cups

### Objective
This initiative aims to shed light on the environmental and health challenges associated with paper cup usage through data-driven visualizations. By focusing on metrics like CO₂ emissions, water consumption, and waste management, this project seeks to generate awareness and inspire actionable solutions.

### Data Analysis Summary
#### 1. Simulated Dataset
The dataset showcases key metrics and patterns related to paper cup manufacturing and its ecological effects. Below are the columns and their descriptions:

| **Column**                          | **Description**                                                                          |
|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Year**                            | Randomly chosen years from 2015 to 2025.                                                 |
| **Paper Cups Produced (million)**   | Random annual values between 800 and 1,500 million cups.                                 |
| **CO₂ Emissions (tons)**            | Random annual values between 200,000 and 400,000 tons.                                   |
| **Water Used (liters)**             | Random annual values between 1,000,000 and 2,000,000 liters.                             |
| **Waste Recycled (%)**              | Random annual recycling percentages between 15% and 50%.                                |
| **Waste Landfilled (%)**            | Calculated as 100% minus recycled waste percentage.                                      |

#### 2. Data Visualization Goals and Plot Descriptions
The following visualizations were crafted to illustrate the environmental implications of paper cups:

1. **Line Chart: Yearly Trends in Production and CO₂ Emissions (2015–2025)**
   - **Purpose:** Show how paper cup production trends correlate with CO₂ emissions.
   - **Insight:** Demonstrates a steady increase in both production and emissions, stressing the need for sustainable alternatives.

2. **Bar Chart: Recycling Rates vs. Landfill Waste**
   - **Purpose:** Compare annual recycling efforts with landfill contributions.
   - **Insight:** While recycling has improved, a considerable share of waste still ends up in landfills, highlighting the need to reduce usage.

3. **Waterfall Chart: Benefits of Reducing Paper Cups**
   - **Purpose:** Display the cumulative environmental savings of using fewer cups.
   - **Insight:** Avoiding paper cups significantly reduces CO₂ emissions and water use, driving individuals and organizations toward sustainable choices.

4. **Heatmap: Relationships Between Production, Emissions, and Water Usage**
   - **Purpose:** Show how these key metrics are interconnected.
   - **Insight:** Demonstrates strong positive correlations, reinforcing the need to address production as a primary sustainability lever.

5. **Pie Chart: Yearly Waste Distribution (Recycled vs. Landfilled)**
   - **Purpose:** Provide a clear snapshot of waste management trends annually.
   - **Insight:** While recycling efforts improve, dependency on landfills remains high, urging innovation in recycling technologies.
