# Hackathon Project: Tech-Driven Solutions to Address the Dual Threat of Paper Cups  

## Objective  
This project aims to address the environmental and health concerns associated with paper cups through **data-driven visualizations**. The visualizations highlight the impact of paper cups on CO₂ emissions, water usage, and waste management, aiming to create awareness and actionable insights.

## Data Analysis Summary  

### 1. **Simulated Dataset**  
The dataset represents key trends and metrics related to paper cup production and its environmental impact. Below are the columns and their purpose:  

| **Column**               | **Description**                                                       |  
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| `Year`                   | Randomly selected years between 2015 and 2025.                       |  
| `Paper Cups Produced (million)` | Random values between 800 and 1,500 million cups annually.           |  
| `CO₂ Emissions (tons)`    | Random values between 200,000 and 400,000 tons annually.             |  
| `Water Used (liters)`     | Random values between 1,000,000 and 2,000,000 liters annually.       |  
| `Waste Recycled (%)`      | Random values between 15% and 50%.                                   |  
| `Waste Landfilled (%)`    | Complement of recycled waste, calculated as `100% - recycled waste %`. |

### 2. **Data Visualization Goals and Plot Explanations**  

The following visualizations were created to provide clear insights into the environmental impact of paper cups:

#### **1. Line Chart: Paper Cups Production vs. CO₂ Emissions (2015–2025)**  
**Why it was created:**  
To demonstrate the trend of paper cup production over time and its correlation with CO₂ emissions.  

**What it says:**  
- The chart shows a steady increase in paper cup production over the years, reflecting growing demand.  
- CO₂ emissions rise alongside production, emphasizing the environmental impact of increased consumption.  
- This trend highlights the urgent need for alternatives to disposable paper cups.

---

#### **2. Bar Chart: Recycling Rates vs. Landfill Waste (Yearly)**  
**Why it was created:**  
To compare the percentage of paper cups recycled versus those sent to landfills each year.  

**What it says:**  
- Recycling rates improve gradually over time, reflecting global efforts toward sustainability.  
- However, a significant portion of waste still ends up in landfills, underscoring the limitations of recycling systems.  
- This visualization emphasizes the importance of reducing overall paper cup usage to minimize landfill contributions.  

---

#### **3. Waterfall Chart: Environmental Impact of Avoiding Paper Cups**  
**Why it was created:**  
To illustrate the cumulative environmental benefits of reducing paper cup usage.  

**What it says:**  
- Shows the reduction in CO₂ emissions and water usage as the number of avoided paper cups increases.  
- The chart provides users with tangible metrics, such as "Avoiding X million cups reduces Y tons of CO₂ emissions and Z liters of water."  
- This motivates individuals and organizations to adopt sustainable practices.  

---

#### **4. Heatmap: Correlation Between Production, Emissions, and Water Usage**  
**Why it was created:**  
To visually display the relationships between key metrics in the dataset.  

**What it says:**  
- A strong positive correlation exists between paper cup production, CO₂ emissions, and water usage.  
- This reinforces the idea that reducing production directly impacts other environmental metrics, making it an essential focus area for sustainability efforts.  

---

#### **5. Pie Chart: Yearly Distribution of Waste (Recycled vs. Landfilled)**  
**Why it was created:**  
To provide a snapshot of waste management for each year in a simple and intuitive format.  

**What it says:**  
- The chart divides waste into recycled and landfilled portions, showing the progress made each year.  
- Highlights the need for more effective recycling technologies and practices to reduce landfill dependency.

## Key Features  

### 1. **Interactive Dashboards**  
- Users can interact with the dashboards to explore the data behind each visualization.  
- Insights such as the yearly impact of avoiding paper cups and improving recycling rates are displayed dynamically.  

### 2. **Actionable Insights**  
- Users are shown how their choices can impact CO₂ emissions and waste through interactive metrics and charts.
